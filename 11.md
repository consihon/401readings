##Part 1 - securing passwords

- there are alot of not so secure ways that you can save a password 
- even though it works slower than alot of the possible ways of encrypting 
a password, the best way to tackle this issue currently is by using bcrypt, the slowness 
of this encryption means that hacking in to get 1 single password would take 100x longer than the
usual time that it could take someone.


##Part 2 - basic access authentication

- HTTP Basic authentication (BA) implementation is the simplest technique for enforcing access controls to web resources because it does not require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages; rather, HTTP Basic authentication uses standard fields in the HTTP header, removing the need for handshakes.
- sent in the header of each HTTP request

## Part 3 - JSON web tokens

 - JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
 - can be used for authorization or information exchange
 
 ####JWT Structure
 - typically consist of three parts, the header, payload, and signature; each separated by dots(aaaaa.bbbbbb.ccccc)
 
 #####header
 
 - usually consists of a token type and a signing algorithm
 
 #####payload
 
 - the payload contains claims, these are statements about the entity that is 
 sending the JWT(typically the user),and any additional data.
 - there are three types of claims
 
    -registered claims; these are predefined claims that are meant to provide a useful, however not required 
    set of inoperable claims 
    - public claims can be defined at will by those using JWTs. but they should use predefined names to avoid colllision
    - private claims are custom claims used to share informatione between parties that agree on using them and are neither registered or public claims
 
 #####signature
 -To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.
  
####why use JWT

- JSON files tend to be more compact than their peers 
- most programming languages have built in JSON parsers and JSON can be directly translated into objects
 
 ## part 4 ..?
 - there is a cheat sheet on git hub but i dont know what im cheating at so its helpfulness is tbd.
